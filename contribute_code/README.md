### Setting up the developement
To create a developement environment follow steps given for Minisat insallation at [chapter 1.2](/chapter_1/minisat_installation.html)

### Setting up test environment
In Minisat, [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is use for testing and [Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/) for Continuous Integration.
All Minisat pull request are tested in [Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/miniSat/minisat). Sometimes tests fail, and when they do you can visit the test job that failed and view its console output.

It is possible for you to run these same tests locally. As most of our testing is done using selenium. For that you need to download [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) webdriver for mozilla firefox. [mozilla geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Extract the driver.
Export path
```sh
export PATH=$PATH/:/path/of/driver
```
It will set a path variable to the webdriver.

And run the test
```sh
pytest
```
